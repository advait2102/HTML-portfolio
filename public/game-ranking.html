<hr />
<h3>The Red Dead Redemption 2</h3>
<p>This game is an absolute marvel and the detailing in this game is unbelievable</p>
<h3>The God of War</h3>
<p>The God of War is a really interesting and also one of the very difficult games I have played. It has a great set of action sequence and the world building is also great and we just love the character</p>
<h3>Ghostwire Tokyo</h3>
<p>This game caught my attention because it was so different from the normal open world games. Its fighting style character design villains are all unique and the game is japanese theme based so its very interesting</p>
